# Test Design: *MP-001*

## Test Design Inputs

### Requirements

MPP-01 Chatty allows to find an existing post by user

## Test Procedure

### Test Setup

```gherkin
Given Autotest Framework is launched
And user server base URI: "http://chatty.telran-edu.de:8989/api" is set
And new user with a random email and password by system is registered
And new user is added to server via POST http method (endpoint "/api/auth/register", body)
And added user ID is returned
And a set of posts is created for the new user
```

| role                    |
|-------------------------|
| "USER", "ADMIN" |

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario Positive:
**MP-001-1** Verify posts can be retrieved by user ID
```gherkin
Given initial setup
When Autotest Framework sends a GET request to "/api/users/{user_id}/posts" with the user_id in the path
Then server returns a list of posts
And Autotest Framework verifies each post has an "id", "title", "description", "body", "imageUrl", "createdAt", "updatedAt", "draft",  "user": {"id", "name", "surname", "phone", "email", "role", "birthDate", "avatarUrl",   "backgroundUrl"

```
### Test Clean Up
Given test scenario is completed
When Autotest Framework deletes the user via DELETE http method (endpoint "/api/users/{id}", id in path)
And deletes all posts of the user
Then user and posts are deleted
