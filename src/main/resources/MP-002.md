# Test Design: *MP-002*

## Test Design Inputs

### Requirements

MPP-02 Chatty allows create a post

## Test Procedure

### Test Setup

```gherkin
Given Autotest Framework is launched
And Chatty server base URI: "http://chatty.telran-edu.de:8989" is set
And valid user credentials are available
```

| role                    |
|-------------------------|
| "USER", "ADMIN" |

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario Positive:
**MP-002-1** Verify a new post can be created successfully
```gherkin
Given initial setup
And Autotest Framework has valid user credentials
When Autotest Framework sends a POST request to the endpoint "api/posts" with the following body:
"""
{
  "title": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "description": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "body": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "imageUrl": "string",
  "publishDate": "[date of test]-[month of test]-[year of test][time of test]",
  "draft": true
}
"""
Then the server returns a 201 status code
And the response body contains the post details with the same filled fields as the request and "userid"
And the post ID is generated and returned in the response
```
#### Scenario Negative:
**MP-002-2** Verify creating a post without title returns an error
```gherkin

Given initial setup
And Autotest Framework has valid user credentials
When Autotest Framework sends a POST request to the endpoint "api/posts" with the following body:
"""
{
  "description": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "body": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "imageUrl": "string",
  "publishDate": "[date of test]-[month of test]-[year of test][time of test]",
  "draft": true
}
"""
Then the server returns a 400 Bad Request status code
And the response body contains an error message indicating the title is required
```

#### Scenario Negative:
**MP-002-3** Verify creating a post with an invalid user ID returns an error
```gherkin
Given initial setup
And Autotest Framework has valid user credentials
When Autotest Framework sends a POST request to the endpoint api/posts" with the following body:
"""
{
  "title": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "description": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "body": "Absd efg hjklmn opqr stuvwxyz 1234567890",
  "userid": "00000"
}
"""
Then the server returns a 404 Not Found status code
And the response body contains an error message indicating the author was not found
```

### Test Clean Up
Given test scenario is completed
When Autotest Framework deletes the created post via DELETE http method, endpoint "/api/posts/id" 
Then the post is deleted
And Autotest Framework confirms the post is no longer retrievable
